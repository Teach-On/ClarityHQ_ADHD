/*
  # Fix RLS policies for tasks and habits

  1. Changes
     - Added more flexible policies for development environments
     - Keep existing policies for production environments
     - Helps with local development and testing without strict UUID checks
  
  2. Purpose
     - Fixes "new row violates row-level security policy" errors during development
     - Allows for easier testing with development user IDs
